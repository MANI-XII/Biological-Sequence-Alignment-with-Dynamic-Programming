# Biological-Sequence-Alignment-with-Dynamic-Programming

The project is designed to simplify sequence analysis
 and comparison tasks for researchers in molecular biology,
 genetics, and related fields, leverages the robust Biopython library
 to offer a wide range of functionalities. This toolkit efficiently ex
 tracts protein structure data from PDB files, optimizes sequence
 lengths for enhanced computational efficiency, and employs var
 ious algorithms for sequence alignment, pattern recognition, and
 similarity measurement. Notable features include global and local
 alignment methods, protein structure comparison techniques, and
 pattern matching algorithms. Additionally, it computes metrics
 such as Levenshtein distance, utilizes the Burrows-Wheeler
 Transform (BWT) for sequence compression and analysis, and
 employs the Wagner-Fischer algorithm for minimum edit dis
 tance calculations. With its intuitive interface and comprehensive
 documentation, the toolkit caters to researchers at all skill levels,
 enabling exploration of biological sequences and facilitating the
 identification of structural motifs, evolutionary relationships, and
 functional implications. By expediting research efforts, this toolkit
 plays a pivotal role in advancing our understanding of life
 sciences, empowering researchers to decipher the complexities
 encoded within biological sequences and fostering innovation in
 the field
